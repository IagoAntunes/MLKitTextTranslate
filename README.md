# MAIL

The MAIL app (yes, it's a pun on AI and ML) is an email application simulator made in Jetpack Compose to explore machine learning and Artificial Intelligence capabilities on Android with Kotlin.

## üî® Project features
The base project has 3 main screens:
- Home tab: List of emails in several languages.
- Email content: When clicking on an item in the initial list, the screen with the body content and subject appears.
- Adjustments: At first it only contains the text stating that there is nothing there.

At the end of the course, our project will be able to:
- Perform real-time analysis of received emails and generate suggested responses, text and emoji.
- Analyze the content of an email, identify which entities are present and highlight them with the help of Jetpack Compose.
- Use the identified entities to generate suggestions for actions, such as opening a map, calling a phone, sending an email, etc.
